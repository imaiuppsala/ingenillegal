The No One is Illegal Network in Östersund (Ingen människa är illegal in Swedish) works to provide practical support to people who are forced to live undocumented after having had their applicatsions for asylum refused. We demand permanent right of residence for all people who have arrived in Sweden and wish to remain. We believe in a world without borders, a world where no one is illegal.
